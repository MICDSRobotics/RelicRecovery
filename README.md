## First Tech Competition 2017-2018 Season

*Currently using version 3.5 of the ftc_app (built on 17.10.30)*

This is a fork of FTC's official [ftc_app](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app) that our team, Technoramic, is using to develop
the code used for the robot this year. You can visit their repository to learn more about FTC and how the SDK they provided
for teams to use in Android Studio for competition.
